The BKS project, the CZ project and the PVHSS project include benchmarking of the BKS scheme, the CZ scheme and the PVHSS scheme, and the performance of these schemes in evaluating multivariate polynomial functions.  
The DecisionTree_BGV_CKKS project and the DecisionTree_PVHSS project show the efficiency of BGV, CKKS and PVHSS for evaluating decision trees on private data.  

#Platforms  
In our paper, we limit the frequency of the CPU to 800MHZ, in order to simulate the resource-restricted clients. If you want to get the same test results as in the paper, you need to limit the CPU frequency to 800MHZ when executing the algorithm on the client side.

#IDE  
In the coding, we chose CLion as IDE. Therefore, if you use CLion as IDE it will help you deploy this project more conveniently.
